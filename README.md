# pern-auth-v1

A full-stack web application built using the PERN stack — PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js — focused on user authentication, real-time visuals, and collaborative features.


---

## 🚀 Description

PREN Login Authentication is a dynamic web application that combines secure user management with a visually engaging interface. This project features an anti-clockwise analog clock, a slider to control clock speed, dynamic messaging from an API, and a shareable link feature for seamless collaboration.

Built as a part of my journey to explore full-stack development, this project pushed me to implement secure authentication and synchronize real-time interactivity with clean UI design.
